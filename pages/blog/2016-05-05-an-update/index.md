Make that three!

I've recently taken the decision to move on from my current role. I'll be spending a few weeks working on things for my own personal enjoyment/benefit. That'll include working on this site, finally getting round to writing some blog posts (such as one of [these](../drafts/)) and brushing up on some neglected parts of my toolset.

Watch this space.
