Ideas for the next post that are currently doing the rounds in my head.

 ***Problems > Solutions*** - we don't spend enough time trying to understand the problems we're working on. Businesses can often display an aversion to really delving into problems they face. This leads to a tendency to placate themselves with "solutions", which are often hastily reached and don't adequately address the real problem.

 ***Working with & for humans*** - this is *actually* the hardest problem in computer science. Based on my experiences I want to share what I think works (sharing context, empathy) and what doesn't (command & control, ignoring biases).

 ***Thoughts on Culture*** - it isn't what you say, or what's on your website, or what's on the office wall. It is the sum total of everything that you do, and how you do it. Be it big or small, everyday or one-off, intentional or unintentional. Everything means something. Probably. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.
