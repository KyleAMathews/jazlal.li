Ideas for the next post that are currently doing the rounds in my head.

***Problems > Solutions*** - we don't spend enough time trying to understand the problems we're working on. Businesses can often display an aversion to really delving into problems they face. This leads to a tendency to placate themselves with "solutions", which are often hastily reached and don't adequately address the real problem.

~***[Technical Recruitment](/blog/thoughts-on-tech-interviews/)*** - I've been through _a lot_ of interviews recently, and I've also conducted a few in my time. Lots to talk about, including interview formats, technical assessments, sourcing, diversity of the talent pool.~

***Something technical*** - I haven't written a technical post in ages, I'd quite like to. I'll take stock of what I've been working on recently and see if there's anything in there I could write about.
