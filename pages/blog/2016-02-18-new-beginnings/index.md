It's time for a refresh. My previous attempts at writing never really took off (6 posts in 2 years, and the last one being in 2014 ðŸ˜ž). So here's to hoping a UI and tech refresh of this site will help light the spark.

Since my last post, I've changed job twice, moved house, transitioned into full-time JavaScript development, caught the React bug, and a whole lot more. I'll endeavour to write thoughts and opinions on such matters here over time.

Round 2.
